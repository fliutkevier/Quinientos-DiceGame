It's a dice game that is popular in Argentina and Uruguay.
The game is typically played with six dice, and players take turns, divided in 3 rolls, to accumulate points based on specific combinations.

## Objective

## About this project

### The Highscore
It doesn't have a default score, and you can go back by pressing any key. **If the app is closed, it will lose all the registered scores**, but everyone who plays without closing the app will be logged in this section.
